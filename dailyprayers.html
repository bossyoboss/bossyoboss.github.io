    <h4>¶ On rising from your bed say immediately:</h4>
    <p>I praise my God this day:</p>
    <p>I give myself to God this day:</p>
    <p>I ask God to help me this day:</p>

    <h4>¶ When dressed, kneel down and say the following:</h4>
    <p>In the Name of the ✠ Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</p>

    <ul>
        <p>Our Father.</p>
        <p>Hail, Mary.</p>
        <p>I Believe.</p>
    </ul>

    <p>
        O God, Thou art my God, who hast made me for Thyself.  
        O Lord, Heavenly Father, to Thee I devote my heart, and my entire life.  
        Grant me Thy grace, I implore thee, that this day I may live as in thy presence,  
        and walk in the path of thy commandments, following the example of my Saviour Christ,  
        and being made like unto him.  
        Give to me thy Holy Spirit that, trusting only in him, I may overcome those sins which beset me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vouchsafe, O gracious God, to me and to...such blessings as we need  
        both temporal and spiritual.  
        I ask in the Name and through the merits of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.
    </p>

    <p>
        O LORD, our heavenly Father, Almighty and everlasting God,  
        who hast safely brought me to the beginning of this day:  
        Defend me in the same with thy mighty power;  
        and grant that this day I fall into no sin,  
        neither run into any kind of danger;  
        but that all my doings, being ordered by thy governance,  
        may be righteous in thy sight.  
        Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
    </p>

    <p>
        May the Almighty and merciful Lord, ✠ Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,  
        bless and preserve me, and bring me to life everlasting. Amen.
    </p>

    <h4>¶ If you have time, the following may be said:</h4>

    <h3 class="sub-header">The Benedictus</h3>
    <p>BLESSED be the Lord God of Israel; * for He hath visited and redeemed his people;</p>
    <p>And hath raised up a mighty salvation for us, * in the house of his servant David;</p>
    <p>As he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets, * which have been since the world began;</p>
    <p>That we should be saved from our enemies, * and from the hand of all that hate us.</p>
    <p>To perform the mercy promised to our forefathers, * and to remember his holy covenant;</p>
    <p>To perform the oath which he sware to our forefather Abraham, * that he would give us;</p>
    <p>That we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies * might serve him without fear;</p>
    <p>In holiness and righteousness before him, * all the days of our life.</p>
    <p>And thou child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: * for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;</p>
    <p>To give knowledge of salvation unto his people * for the remission of their sins,</p>
    <p>Through the tender mercy of our God; * whereby the day-spring from on high hath visited us;</p>
    <p>To give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, * and to guide our feet into the way of peace.</p>
    <p><strong>GLORY BE TO THE FATHER.</strong></p>
