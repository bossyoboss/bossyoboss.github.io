            <h2 class="centered-chapter-title">THE CHRISTIAN’S OBLIGATIONS</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">As to Worship, Fasting and
                Abstinence, and the Six Precepts
                set forth on the basis of the
                Book of Common Prayer, Canon Law,
                and general Catholic Usage </p>

            <h3 class="sub-header">The Church’s Discipline as to Worship </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">The Catholic Church requires regular attendance at its chief act of worship, the Holy
                Eucharist. In the United States the following
                feasts are generally recognized as days upon
                which the faithful are expected, as a matter
                of Christian duty and obligation, to worship
                at the Eucharist, that is to say: </p>

            <h3 class="sub-header">Holy Days of Obligation </h3>
            <p class="paragraph">1. Sundays throughout the year. (Each
                Sunday is the weekly Feast of the Lord, in
                recognition of his resurrection, i.e., the
                Lord’s Day.)</p>
            <p class="paragraph">2. Christmas Day—December 25th—(the
                Feast of his Nativity, in recognition of the
                beginning of his redemptive work). </p>
            <p class="paragraph">3. The Circumcision—January 1st—(the
                Octave of Christmas, and itself a Feast of the Incarnation. Also the dedication of the
                New Year).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">4. Ascension Day (in honor of the final
                glorification of our humanity in Christ’s
                Person). </p>
            <p class="paragraph">5. All Saints’ Day—November 1st—(in
                honor of Christ’s triumphs in redeemed humanity).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Other festivals, formerly Holy Days of
                Obligation and still generally recognized as
                Feasts on which the instructed Churchman
                will naturally be impelled to worship at the
                Eucharist, are:</p>

            <h3 class="sub-header">Special Days of Devotion</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">1. The Annunciation of the B.V.M.—
            March 25th—(in recognition of God becoming Man by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin
            Mary).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">2. Corpus Christi—the Thursday after Trinity Sunday—(in thanksgiving for the Bread of Life).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">3. and 4. The Assumption—August 15th—
                and the Conception of the B.V.M.—December 8th—(being the chief Feasts of our Lady,
                the former her “heavenly birthday,” the latter a feast early introduced from the East
                into the West by the Church of England).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The above Days of Obligation binding on
                all (with the Special Days of Devotion for those who are cognizant of their impelling
                character) constitute a normal minimum of
                eucharistic worship, although special circumstances may in special cases excuse the individual therefrom, and growth in the spiritual
                life will lead to a more frequent attendance,
                even daily when possible. In particular the
                Prayer-Book Holy Days and others of similar character (that is, all Holy Days of sufficient note to merit the formal title “Days of
                Devotion’) are marked out for us by Catholic usage as specially appropriate occasions
                for eucharistic worship.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-header">The Church’s Discipline as to Fasting and Abstinence</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Fasting is a Christian duty. In modern
                times it is customary to distinguish between
                abstinence (in which the quality of food is
                lowered, usually by not eating meat) and
                fasting (in which the quantity of food is reduced as well) although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. The discipline
                “which the Church requires” is widely recognized to be the following:</p>
            <h3 class="sub-header">Rules of Fasting and Abstinence</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">1. Abstinence from flesh meat on Fridays
                throughout the year (except those falling on
                Christmas or Epiphany or between those
                feasts).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">2. Fasting, usually meaning not more
                than a light breakfast, one full meal, and
                one half meal, on the forty days of Lent. (Lent consists of forty days from Ash Wednesday to Easter Even, exclusive of the Sundays which
                fall within this period. Because Sunday is the weekly
                feast of Christ’s resurrection, the rule of fasting has
                never applied to this day of the week under any circumstances.)
                 </p>
            <p class="paragraph">3. Fasting with abstinence on Ember
                Days and on Fridays in Lent. </p>
            <P class="paragraph">Those who cannot choose their food (soldiers, certain employees, etc.) should eat
                what is set before them, although they should
                welcome the opportunity to observe abstinence. (It is understood, however, that in
                tropical countries; where meat is hard to
                obtain and therefore not an ordinary part of
                the diet, abstinence is commuted to some
                other form of discipline than going without
                flesh meat.) Illness, old age, extreme youth,
                and heavy manual work excuse from fasting,
                but the major Fast Days of Ash Wednesday
                and Good Friday, as the American Prayer
                Book indicates, are stricter in obligation,
                though not in observance, than the other
                Fast Days, and therefore should not be neglected except in cases of serious illness or
                other necessity of an absolute character.</P>
            <p class="paragraph">The desire to imitate the stricter fasts of previous ages, or of saintly ascetics such as
                the Tractarians, may be a moving of divine
                love, or sometimes it may be a love of singularity. But since the practice may be unwise,
                it should never be undertaken without consultation with a competent spiritual guide. </p>
            <p class="paragraph">However, certain Vigils, formerly of obligation but no longer listed in the American
                Prayer Book, may commendably be observed
                by fasting and abstinence, in honor of the
                labors of our Lord and His Saints, as:</p>
            <h3 class="sub-header">Fasts of Devotion</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">1. Christmas Eve.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">2. Vigil of Pentecost.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">3. Vigil of All Saints.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Easter Even is a Vigil, but is not listed
                as a Fast of Devotion because it is normally
                observed as a Lenten day of fasting. </p>
            <h3 class="sub-header">The Eucharistic Fast</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The traditional fast before Communion
                has never been primarily an act of penance,
                but one of homage to our Lord, its purpose
                being that of receiving the Blessed Sacrament as the first food of the day. Thus from
                early days the Communion fast has been an
                absolute prohibition of anything in the way
                of food or drink from the previous midnight.
                In our day, however, it has been realized that this strict fast impedes the realization of
                the aims of the Liturgical Movement in restoring the reception of Communion as an
                element in the normal participation in the
                Eucharistic Sacrifice, in adjusting the hours
                of Mass to modern conditions, in the restoration of Communion late in the day during
                Holy Week, etc. This has tended to a reemphasis upon Communion as a primary
                consideration with the preparatory fast as
                secondary. It is therefore widely held that, in
                cases where the observance of the strict fast
                would make impossible the reception of
                Holy Communion, enough food or drink
                may be taken to make full Eucharistic participation possible. Some bishops have promulgated a mitigated fast in definite terms,
                and those living in such jurisdictions should
                abide by these rules. Generally, the drinking
                of water and the taking of medicine is today
                almost universally considered to have no
                effect upon this fast, and the sick are widely
                considered to be exempted from the fast
                entirely. Where there is any question about
                this fast, the faithful should consult their
                pastor, for the Priest who dispenses the sacrament is the guardian of the Church’s requirements; but the principle that reception
                of Communion is more important than any
                fast in preparation for it should always guide
                in this matter. </p>
            <h3 class="sub-header">The Ordinary Catholic Duties</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Churchmen need a clear knowledge of the
                fundamental rules of discipline which are
                part of the Catholic heritage of the Episcopal Church, and these are to be found in a
                simple summary which, in contrast to the
                Ten Commandments of God, are known as:</p>
            <h3 class="sub-header">The Six Precepts of the Church</h3>
            <h4 class="sub-header-ital">Being the Irreducible Minimum
                of Catholic Practice</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">1. Of Mass. To assist at Mass every Sunday and Holy Day of Obligation. </p>
            <p class="paragraph">2. Of Fast and Abstinence. To keep the
                fasts and abstinences, prescribed in the
                Prayer Book, according to normal Catholic
                custom.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">3. Of Confession. To seek sacramental
                absolution when needed for mortal sin, and
                at Easter time to do so as a matter of obedience to normal Catholic custom.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">4. OfCommunion. To receive Holy Communion at least once a year, during Eastertide.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">5. Of Almsgiving. To give regularly to
                the support of the Church and the ministry.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">6. Of Marriage. To keep the Church’s
                law of marriage.</p>
