<div class="prayer">
    <h3 class="sub-header">When unable to attend mass</h3>
    <p>In the Name of the ✠ Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</p>

        <p><i>Our Father.</i></p>

    <h3 class="sub-header">Collect</h3>
    <p>LET the power of the Holy Spirit come 
        upon me, O Lord, I beseech thee: that 
        he may both mercifully cleanse my heart 
        and defend me from all adversities. Through 
        Christ our Lord. Amen. </p>

    <h3 class="sub-header">The Epistle (Revelation 3:20)</h3>
    <p>BEHOLD I stand at the door, and knock: if 
        any man hear my voice, and open the 
        door, I will come in to him, and will sup 
        with him, and he with me. </p>

    <h3 class="sub-header">The Gospel (St. John 15:5)</h3>
    <p>I AM the vine, ye are the branches. He that 
        abideth in me, and I in him, the same 
        bringeth forth much fruit: for without me 
        ye can do nothing. </p>

    <h3 class="sub-header">Act of Contrition</h3>
    <p>O God, I am very sorry that I have sinned 
        against thee who art so good. Forgive 
        me for Jesus’ sake, and I will try to sin no 
        more. </p>

    <h3 class="sub-header">Act of Reception</h3>
    <p>IN Union, dear Lord, with the faithful at 
        every altar of thy Church where thy 
        blessed Body and Blood are being offered 
        to the Father, I desire to offer thee praise 
        and thanksgiving. I believe that thou art truly 
        present in the Holy Sacrament. And since I 
        cannot now receive thee sacramentally, I 
        beseech thee to come spiritually into my heart. 
        I unite myself unto thee, and embrace thee 
        with all the affections of my soul. Let me 
        never be separated from thee. Let me live 
        and die in thy love. Amen. </p>
    
    <p>COME Lord Jesus, dwell in thy servant in 
        the fulness of thy strength, in the perfection 
        of thy ways, and in the holiness of 
        thy spirit, and rule over every hostile power 
        in the might of thy Spirit, and to the glory of 
        thy Father. Amen. </p>
        
    <p>MAY the Body and Blood of our Lord 
        Jesus Christ preserve my body and 
        soul unto everlasting life. Amen. </p>

    <h3 class="sub-header">Anima Christi</h3>
    <p>
        SOUL of Christ, sanctify me.<br>
        Body of Christ, save me;<br>
        Blood of Christ, inebriate me;<br>
        Water from the side of Christ, wash me;<br>
        Passion of Christ, strengthen me;<br>
        O good Jesu, hear me;<br>
        Within thy wounds hide me;<br>
        Suffer me not to be separated from thee;<br>
        From the malicious enemy defend me;<br>
        In the hour of my death call me,<br>
        And bid me come to thee.<br>
        That with thy Saints I may praise thee<br>
        For ever and ever. Amen.
