## Seriously, some minimal fucking things are needed to make this shit perfect.
xcvbxc that [grotesque pile of shit](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) into this finally perfect masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:
asdfsdfghsdfcvbxcv

### And guess what, motherfucker:

You never knew it, but it's easy to improve reliability on your site. Here's how.

## A little more accessibility

I know youhfdghvbncvbzxcv
## Typography matters

[Don't be dumb with typography](https://smartquotesforsmartpeople.com/). Don't let improper marks and quotes make their way onto websites because of dumb defaults in applications and CMSs.  
And did you let the browser choose the font? Don't make me read such text with _Times New Roman_.

## License, motherfucker

Do you revendicate intellectual property? No. So you must [choose a fucking public license](https://choosealicense.com/).  
And as you'll never be perfect, let others [improve your shit](https://github.com/LeoColomb/perfectmotherfuckingwebsite) or [do what the fuck they want to](https://github.com/LeoColomb/perfectmotherfuckingwebsite/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Yes, this is the last fucking satire, you fuck

I'm impressed about what the creator of [this site's inspiration did](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/). What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default—they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.
